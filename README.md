# TAV Mobil - Next.js Starter (Dark & Responsive)

This scaffold contains a minimal Next.js project using Tailwind-ready CSS and Framer Motion for animations.
Files created; to run locally:

1. Extract the zip.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Notes:
- The `public/hero.webp` and other image placeholders are empty files (place your brochure images there).
- Framer Motion is already added in dependencies.
- Tailwind is configured; run `npx tailwindcss -i ./styles/globals.css -o ./styles/output.css --watch` only if you need to compile manually.
